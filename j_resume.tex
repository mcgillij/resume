& At AnalyzeRE I focus more on DevOps projects due to a skills gap in the team, meanwhile I'm democratising the DevOps process to ramp up the rest of the team and build their confidence in our builds and releases.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf {Build} Docker-ized the build process, allowing cattle vs pet build boxes
\item \textbf {Build} Consolidated the build process to allow the local development and Jenkins to use the same workflows
\item \textbf {Automation} Ported their 150~ manually configured build jobs to Jenkinsfiles accross all repositories
\item \textbf {Migration} Migrated legacy SaltStack manual provisioning and orchestration to automated Terraform
\item \textbf {Infra} Overhauled the old lift and shift infrastructure design to a cloud native solution, using Terraform and Packer.
\item \textbf {Planning} Designed infrastructure for a new product iteration to be cloud native infrastructure and serverless .
\item \textbf {Infra} Moved from  manually provisioned compute resources to auto-scaling spot fleets for build systems, reducing cost by 90\%
\item \textbf {QA} Built out benchmarking framework to allow spotting trends in performance over master builds.
\item \textbf {DB} Created enterprise database backup / restores over our AWS accounts using KMS / CMK's.
